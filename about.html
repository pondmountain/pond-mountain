	<div id="about">
		<p>What can you say about such a beautiful place?  Well...probably a heck of a lot!<br>
		Nestled in the absolute and I mean absolute mostest north westernest part of North Carolina in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains and hell and gone from, well... <strong><em>anywhere!</em></strong><br>
		Up here we take life at a little different pace then it seems most other people do...<strong><em>wide &nbsp ass &nbsp open!</em></strong><br><br>
		I reckon it is the only way we can keep from freezing!  You sit around here to long and your butt cheeks might get frozen to something.<br><br>
		You see the view from the Pond Mountain Ponderosa is a <u>sight to be hold!</u>  That is for about 6 weeks...<br>
		Other wise if you don't like the color <strong>white</strong> then I would advise you to <em>stay home!</em><br>
		But don't worry if you do decide to brave the trip to come see us at any time other then July,<br><br>
		and you find that your vehicle can not gain the proper traction due to a foot thick sheet of ice<br>
		we do have a bulldozer that can get you out!<br>
		We will require that a waiver is signed prior to tow...<br><br>
		But once you are up here, and you figure out which snow drift is actually the house,<br>
		we can do lots of wonderful things, like, cut down some trees, chop some wood, ice fish, chop more wood, fix fence,<br>
		figure out where the tractor went, chase some cows, chop wood, or we can just sit back with a hot tottie and watch<br>
		Mollie B's Polka hour on RFD-TV...that is if the wind hasn't blown away the satellite dish...<br>
		Can't wait to see ya!  Our axes are always sharp, should decide to drop in!</p>
